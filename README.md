# Password-Generator

## Description 

This [Password Generating Website](mattdack.github.io/password-generator) allows the user to create randomized passwords based on a number of entry criteria. I.E. how long should the password be? Should it include lower case, uppercase, numbers, or special characters? The website uses prompts to collect this information, store in variables, and utilizes it to create a password according to user criteria.
